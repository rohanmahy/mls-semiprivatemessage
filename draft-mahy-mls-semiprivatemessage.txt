  Semi-Private Messages in the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol
                draft-mahy-mls-semiprivatemessage-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a SemiPrivateMessage for the Messaging Layer
   Security (MLS) protocol.  It allows members to share otherwise
   private commits and proposals with a designated list of external
   receivers rather than send these handshakes in a PublicMessage.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two extensions of MLS [RFC9420].  The first is
   the SemiPrivateMessage wire format Safe Extension (see
   Section 2.1.7.1 of [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions], which allows an
   otherwise PrivateMessage to be shared with a predefined list of
   external receivers.  It is restricted for use only with commits or
   proposals.  The second is the external_receivers GroupContext
   extension that contains the list of external receivers and allows
   members to agree on that list.

   SemiPrivateMessages are expected to be useful in federated
   environments where messages routinely cross multiple administrative
   domains, but the MLS Distribution Service needs to see the content of
   commits and proposals where group members would otherwise send
   handshakes using PublicMessage.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology extensively from MLS [RFC9420] and the
   Safe Extensions framework, defined in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions].

3.  Syntax and Usage

   The external_receivers GroupContext extension is used for all members
   to agree on the list of external receivers in the current epoch.  Its
   construction mirrors the syntax of the external_senders extension in
   [RFC9420].

   struct {
     HPKEPublicKey external_receiver_public_key;
     Credential credential;
   } ExternalReceiver;

   The SemiPrivateMessage wire format Safe Extension also has an
   extension type which is carried in the GroupContext to indicate use
   of the wire format in a group (and in the Capabilities of LeafNodes).
   SemiPrivateMessage substantially reuses the construction of
   PrivateMessage, but like a Welcome message also contains information
   (keys_and_nonces) necessary to decrypt the SemiPrivateMessage
   struct's ciphertext and encrypted_sender_data, encrypted once for
   each external receiver in the external_receivers extension.

   The snippet below shows the syntax and encryption and decryption
   construction of keys_and_nonces into encrypted_keys_and_nonces

   struct {
     opaque sender_data_key<V>;
     opaque sender_data_nonce<V>;
     opaque key<V>;
     opaque nonce<V>;
   } PerMessageKeysAndNonces;

   PerMessageKeysAndNonces keys_and_nonces;

   encrypted_keys_and_nonces = EncryptWithLabel(
     external_receiver_public_key,
     "SemiPrivateMessageReceiver",
     SemiPrivateMessage.ciphertext,   /* context */
     keys_and_nonces)

   keys_and_nonces = DecryptWithLabel(
     external_receiver_private_key,
     "SemiPrivateMessageReceiver",
     SemiPrivateMessage.ciphertext,  /* context */
     encrypted_keys_and_nonces.kem_output,
     encrypted_keys_and_nonces.ciphertext)

   The KeyForExternalReceiver structure contains a hash of the
   ExternalReceiver as a reference and the encrypted_keys_and_nonces.

   /* Using the hash function of the group ciphersuite */
   ExternalReceiverRef = hash(ExternalReceiver)

   struct {
     ExternalReceiverRef external_receiver_ref;
     HPKECiphertext encrypted_keys_and_nonces;
   } KeyForExternalReceiver;

   The SemiPrivateMessage struct mirrors the PrivateMessage struct and
   adds the keys_for_external_receivers list.  The SemiPrivateContentAAD
   struct mirrors the PrivateContentAAD struct.  It likewise adds the
   keys_for_external_receivers list, and also adds a hash of the
   FramedContentTBS struct to insure that the content encrypted to an
   external receiver is that same as that provided to members.

   The SemiPrivateMessageContent struct is the same as
   PrivateMessageContent except for the addition of
   keys_for_external_receivers, and that application messages are not
   included.

   Encryption of the ciphertext and encrypted_sender_data proceed in the
   same way for SemiPrivateMessage as for PrivateMessage.  Finally, as a
   safe wire format extension, the SemiPrivateMessage is wrapped in an
   ExtensionContent struct.

   struct {
       opaque group_id<V>;
       uint64 epoch;
       ContentType content_type;
       opaque authenticated_data<V>;
       KeyForExternalReceiver keys_for_external_receivers<V>;
       opaque encrypted_sender_data<V>;
       opaque ciphertext<V>;
   } SemiPrivateMessage;

   struct {
       select (PrivateMessage.content_type) {
           case proposal:
             Proposal proposal;
           case commit:
             Commit commit;
       };
       KeyForExternalReceiver keys_for_external_receivers<V>;
       FramedContentAuthData auth;
       opaque padding[length_of_padding];
   } SemiPrivateMessageContent;

   struct {
       opaque group_id<V>;
       uint64 epoch;
       ContentType content_type;
       opaque authenticated_data<V>;
       KeyForExternalReceiver keys_for_external_receivers<V>;
       opaque framed_content_tbs_hash<V>;
   } SemiPrivateContentAAD;

   /* IANA-registered value for semi_private_message */
   extension_type = TBD2
   SemiPrivateMessage extension_data;

4.  Security Considerations

   These two extensions provide a privacy improvement over sending
   handshake messages using PublicMessage.  The handshake is shared with
   a specific list of receivers, and that list is visible as part of the
   GroupContext.

   TODO More Security.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  SemiPrivateMessage Wire Format

   The semi_private_message MLS Extension Type is used to signal support
   for the SemiPrivateMessage Wire Format (a Safe Extension).

   *  Value: TBD1 (to be assigned by IANA)

   *  Name: semi_private_message

   *  Recommended: Y

   *  Reference: RFC XXXX

5.2.  External Receivers Extension Type

   The external_receivers extension contains a list of external
   receivers targeted in a SemiPrivateMessage.

   *  Value: TBD2 (to be assigned by IANA)

   *  Name: external_receivers

   *  Message(s): GC.  This extension may appear in GroupContext
      objects.

   *  Recommended: Y

   *  Reference: RFC XXXX
